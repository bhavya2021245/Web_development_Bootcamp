$("h1") does exactly the same as document.querySelector ("h1")
($ is not defined) so if we don't have any jQuery then it's not really going to work. so 
incorporate it using the script tag and we're going to paste that above our Javascript script tag.
Now because the browser does not care about tabs, indents, spaces, and comments it completely
ignores all of it there is no point in asking the user to load up all of this unnecessary info, 
and by minifying it we get rid of those things and make our web site load much faster.
there's no difference between selecting one or selecting many.
we can manipulate the CSS style of the selected element by simply using the .css method from jquery
$(h1).css(add property we want to change,the value for that property)
it is flexible as you can get the current value of CSS property by simply having the 
name of the property. but we have to keep separate the styling from javascript so just add a class to that element using 
.addClass and also remove class to add multiple classes all we need to do is just include them inside the same set of quotation marks.
.hasClass method to check whether the element has that particular class.
using inner HTML we not just update text but we were also able to add HTML so as we are using jQuery use .html only
$("button").text("<em>Hey</em>") output is <em>Hey</em> it will ignore html tags 
but $("button").html("<em>Hey</em>") output is hey(em tag is for emphasized tag)
get the value of the attribute using .attr("name of attribute") for eg src in img and href in link
to set the attribute .attr("name of attribute", "value") class is also the attribute
.click(function() {});
This will add an event listener and call this callback function once it detects a click for adding event listeners to all buttons we 
do not have to loop because by selecting a button jquery will look through your website and select all of the buttons and if you combine that with the click 
method then this will add this click listener to all the buttons that it finds without using a loop.
on method, two parameters first one is the event that ur looking for the second parameter is the callback function
add new elements while our website is live using before,after, prepend and append
diff bw prepend and before new element before the opening tag of the selected element
after: new element after the closing tag of the selected element
prepend: add an element just before the content of the selected element
append:  add element just after the content of the selected element
$("h1").hide so when we click any button in our web page it should try to hide h1
.show() to show if toggle hide and show then use .toggle
.animate allows you to animate inside parenthesis we can insert a 
set of curly braces and inside the curly braces we are going to add our CSS rule that 
we are going to animate to(only rules which have numeric value)
