Backend
The server which is basically just a computer
application which is all the logic that enables the web app to function
(how to respond to the requests from the browser) a database where you can store and 
retrieve user data
web pages are just bits of HTML that get requested from the browser to our server and server 
then returns that HTML file that gets rendered on the browser.
Firstly, you enter the restaurant.you take a look at the menu, which essentially is all 
of the functionality that this particular web app has. So you click on this button on a website 
or in the case of our restaurant, you tell the waiter your order from the menu, and then what the 
waiter is going to do is he's going to traverse from the front end to the back end. And this is 
what happens when your browser sends that request to your server. The server is effectively the 
same as the kitchen in the restaurant. It's open 24 over seven.That's coming from our waiter, from 
the front end, from the restaurant and in the server there areapplications, which is basically our chefs.
And what our chefs are able to do is they have lots of recipes.They know exactly how to respond to different requests from the client.
It checks the recipe it sees.Oh, we need some data from our database.If we imagine the pantry as the database of the restaurant, then what the chef or the 
application isgoing to do is going to request those ingredients or those pieces of data to process it or work withit somehow.And then at the end, it's going to 
send back a response to the front end.
So in this case, we got some pancakes that were made in the kitchen and sent into the front of house,
which is the restaurant, and in our server that could be some HTML, CSS and JavaScript files that
got created or retrieved and sent over to the front end.
